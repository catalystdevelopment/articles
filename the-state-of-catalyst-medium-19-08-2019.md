# The State of Catalyst 19 AugÂ 2019

Hello everyone and welcome to the State of Catalyst for August 19th, 2019.

This is our second article in our series of posts about Catalyst, in order to keep you updated about the life of our currency and its steadily growing community.

**Our Funding system is well under way!**

This will streamline the process of funding new projects, making it easy for us to organize as a team to provide cutting-edge services to our users! 

> We look for any way to strengthen and decentralize our platform, if you have an ideas, we will do our best to help you make them into a reality.

**Our GUI Wallet is now out!**

In today's day and age, many computer users are not (yet) command-line jockeys, as such, we have released a new GUI wallet, making it easy for anyone to start interacting on the Catalyst network by managing their wallet and sending and receiving Catalyst.  This is by no means the end of the road for GUI wallet development, we are actively working on additional features and an improved user experience! 

**Our new Webminer**

Although not currently as effiecient as mining directly, we provide web miners for people who simply want to mine from their browser with no hassle, and it provides a good way to show friends and family how they can easily mine from their browser and start collecting funds before introducing them to more sophisticated and effiecient means of mining Catalyst.

**New Pools!**
Shout-out to our friends MunchieHigh420@SpookyPool.nl and Clucky@wrkz.stroppyscryptos.net for building some new CX pools for the community!

**Codebase. (Development status)**
While no changes have been made this week, we are always on the look out for ways of improving our underlying Blockchain infrastructure, whether it be improving security, usability, or speed.  We are actively engaged with other Blockchain communities, researching what works, and implementing into our own codebase.

**Community meetings.**
As evidenced by our social media community, we are actively engaged in providing the best user experience possible for our users on a daily basis, however, we will be announcing more formal meetings on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/catalyst_CX) where decisions will be made in regards to the direction of our Network, stay tuned!
