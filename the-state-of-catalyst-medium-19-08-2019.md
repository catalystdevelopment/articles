# The State of Catalyst 12 AugÂ 2019

Hello everyone and welcome to the State of Catalyst for August 19th, 2019.

This is our second article in our series of posts about Catalyst, in order to keep you updated about the life of our currency and its steadily growing community.

**Our Funding system is well under way!**

> This will streamline the process of funding new projects, making it easy for us to organize as a team to provide cutting-edge services to our users! 

**Our GUI Wallet is now out!**

In today's day and age, many computer users are not (yet) command-line jockeys, as such, we have released a new GUI wallet, making it easy for anyone to start interacting on the Catalyst network by managing their wallet and sending and receiving Catalyst.  This is by no means the end of the road for GUI wallet development, we are actively working on additional features and an improved user experience! 

**Would you like to start your own pool?**

We have made it easy to start your own Catalyst [pool](url-placeholder), drop into our [discord]() if you have any questions!

We look for any way to strengthen and decentralize our platform, if you have an ideas, we will do our best to help you make them into a reality.
