# The State of Catalyst 12 AugÂ 2019

Hello everyone and welcome to the State of Catalyst for August 12th, 2019.

With this article, we are starting a series of posts about Catalyst, in order to keep you updated about the life of our currency and its steady growing community.

Currently, the blockchain is running on block 434387 this means, that last week we celebrated a 300-day anniversary. Sure, Catalyst is still pretty young, but it's getting better each day, we don't want to rush thing out, instead, we are taking small steps to improve the project and to deliver the awesome things almost every day, to ensure the long life-span, and to be ready for the mass adoption.

**We now have a Catalyst Paper Wallet!**

> This will make it easy for you to introduce your friends and family to Catalyst by showing them how, by writing down and protecting their mnemonic seed, they will always have access to their funds! Chck it out.

We want Catalyst to be accessible to everyone, even if you are not a tech-savvy type of person, this is why currently we are working hard on releasing a GUI wallet, it was always up in our priority list, but now we decided to give it an extra push.

**New pool.**

To distribute the hash power, and make the network more secure, we started an official mining pool:

> All the profits from the pool fee will be transferred to the Catalyst development fund in order to sustain the project and will be used in the future for various community events.

We even went a bit further and created a merged mining pool with UltraNote!

UltraNote (XUN) is an amazing project that continues to carry on the XDN torch, mining it with Catalyst will allow you to support both chains and improve the overall efficiency of your mining hardware!

We want to thank XUN developers team for supporting our poll with a reasonable donation and looking forward to working together on creating a healthy space for all of you crypto-enthusiasts out there!

Unfortunately, we are still short on the pool's side, which is why we highly encourage our community members to start their own pools, there is enough space for everyone! Just use one of our detailed guides, or if you are new to this sort of things, contact us on Discord, and we will walk you through the set-up process.

> It is possible to mine Catalyst with other coins, like Aeon, let us know if you want to try it.

**Block explorer.**

To help you track your transactions and monitor the network health status, we released a new block explorer with slick design from Conceal network team.

We think that robust infrastructure is one of the keys to success, which is why we are always looking to improve it on our side.

**CryptUnit platform listing.**

We have been listed on CryptUnit analytics platform, which is an amazing place to track UltraNote coins various analytic data. Now you can monitor Catalyst profitability and other important parameters over time and integrate that data into your technical analysis, which will allow you to make much more educated long term decisions.

**Codebase. (Development status)**

The development branch is up and running like a beaut, we are trying to be in sync with the latest Turtle Coin codebase, which includes all the recent fixes and enhancements, in addition, we implement new features on top of that, making Catalyst unique.

We've had a hot discussion in our Discord with the community members about the Algorithm change, the code is completely ready, though it's still under the question, what is the best PoW algorithm for us to adopt, whether it be Argon2id, Kangaroo Twelve or RandomX or maybe we should implement our own hashing function. The main concern is the threat that the new generation of ASIC and FPGA units are representing. Should we take preventive measures to protect us from these threats in the future, or wait and react according to the situation. Please let us know what you think in the comments below!

Eventually, we want Catalyst to be fully accessible on mobile platforms, one way of doing this is to make the blockchain sync process as smooth as possible, which is why we are looking into adding checkpoints, making the chain even smaller, the current code base is very stable and optimized thanks to the turtle coin team refactoring and optimizations. The software needed to synchronize the blockchain has very low memory and traffic usage, making it possible to run on budget smartphones and weak internet connection.

**Community meetings.**

From now on we are going to schedule, community meetings once every couple of weeks, where we will discuss the current matters, and you will be able to interact directly with the dev. team. The exact date will be announced on Twitter.
